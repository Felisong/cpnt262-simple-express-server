# Local Express Server

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an Express.js server that serves HTML content. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. In this project, I've created a simple server that serves static HTML pages, showcasing the fundamental concepts of routing and serving files with Express.

Note: I wrote a very full fledged read me, and then I lost it due to some shenanigans I got up to in a previous commit, in a different branch. I got perplexity to write up a good portion of this as I did not want to have to repeat myself word for word. I have gone in and made adjustments and improvements.
