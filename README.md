# Local Express Server

Hi! My name is Carolina, I am a student studying web development at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology). This is a lab to create a basic web server using Node.js and Express. I'll serve HTML pages with basic CSS styling, creating a simple website that runs locally.

I will be using a previous lab of building an [html webpage](https://github.com/Felisong/melee-webpage) I styled it for fun when I was learning css.

Other than that I will begin initializing and add to this later.
