# Local Express Server

Hi! My name is Carolina, I am a student studying web development at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology). This is a lab to create a basic web server using Node.js and Express. I'll serve HTML pages with basic CSS styling, creating a simple website that runs locally.
